2- tips and tricks

- try website IP instead of domain so waf cannot block you use shodan
- if you're able to find a JSON POST-based potential SQL injection (SQLi), remember to execute the SQLMAP query with -u and --data using JSON input.
- change Content-type for example changing to Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded this might alllow u to exploit Incorrect Server-Side Handling,bypass waf
- change request method to get or post
- change http version
- change https to http
- after finding param get 404 we can use waybackurls -dates to find other avialble archived version of the same param
